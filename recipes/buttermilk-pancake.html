        <p>These are the best buttermilk pancakes. This recipe is handed down from my grandmother.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>Â½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <li>Preheat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl; mix thoroughly. Add 3 cups buttermilk, vegetable oil, and eggs; mix thoroughly by hand with a spoon. Add more buttermilk to adjust consistency if needed. Batter should be slightly lumpy but not too thick; pancakes will be flat if batter is overmixed.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, spoon batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until the bubbles that form on the top surface begin to pop, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes more.</li>
