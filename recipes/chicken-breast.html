        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>My family loves grilled chicken on a stick, and this recipe is so simple to make with boneless chicken breasts and Italian-style salad dressing. <br> All you have to do is marinate the chicken briefly, then skewer it on sticks and cook on the grill for tender, tasty chicken.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon meat tenderizer</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag; sprinkle with meat tenderizer. Pour in dressing and turn chicken to coat thoroughly; squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place chicken onto skewers and cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
