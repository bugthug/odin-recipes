        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon meat tenderizer</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag; sprinkle with meat tenderizer. Pour in dressing and turn chicken to coat thoroughly; squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place chicken onto skewers and cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
